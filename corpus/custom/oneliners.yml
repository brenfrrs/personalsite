  - Can't do that, but I can cd into different sections. For example `cd blog` works. You can also type `clear` to clear the conversation and start fresh.

  -  No way, really?
- - cd projects

- - cd datasets
  - <script>click_section(1)</script>
- - cd blog
  - <script>click_section(2)</script>
- - cd about
  - <script>click_section(4)</script>
