<p class="about_me_body">I'm Brendan Ferris, a Data Scientist with a background in Private Investigations. I first became interested in Data Science after seeing first-hand how fraud analytics directs the investigative resources of the insurance industry. This led me to develop the skills to solve problems with numbers.   </p>
